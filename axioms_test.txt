The testfile for axioms
Passing the this file without any errors is the goal of the project

Test sections

1.) Initializing expression graphs
    - Validity of expressions
    - Recognizing errors and returning helpful messages

2.) Evaluating expression graphs
    - Expressions are evaluated correctly
    - Expressions that cannot be evaluated return None

3.) Solving Graphs
    - Returns the correct amount of solutions for graphs
    - Returns the correct solutions for graphs
    - Solve's for solvable values and returns the values that cannot be solved for

4.) Calculus
    - Solves for derivatives of functions
    - Numerical analysis for estimating solutions to non analytical algebraic problems

*** Stretch ***
4.) Linear regression

5.) Automating readable work in Latex
    - returns work that can be followed/read by a person in a movable format
